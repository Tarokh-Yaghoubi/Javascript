// Semicolon is a delimiter in JS 
// Also line-break is treated as a delimiter, so that would also work

console.log("first"); console.log("second");

console.log("third")
console.log("fourth")       // these two are different statements 

// It is a better practice to put a semicolon 

// even if we put some extra semi-colon somewhere in the code 
// it will not be an error, it will be just ignored 

// to fully enable all features of modern JS, we should use 'use strict' at the beginning of the scripts
